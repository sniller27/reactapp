#ReactJS Application
My first ReactJS app. The current goal is to play with React, and use the UI Framework, Material UI to build interesting Material Design.

##Installation
Install from package.json

```sh
npm install
```
Run on server (port: 7777). This can be changed in config file.
```sh
npm start
```
Go to http://localhost:7777/
